# cs375_BSTproject
Our group will switch to the binary search tree structure and associated algorithms. We will implement and evaluate the running time of the associated search, insert, and deletion algorithms. We will evaluate the time differences for the algorithms between a balanced binary search tree and a worse case binary search tree. We hope to illustrate the differences found in the running times of best and worse case binary search trees of equivalent size.

We will divide the algorithms between us while compile our code together through GitHub. This will ensure we all understand the algorithms involved and have access to each others code at all stages of the programming processs.

We will use C++ to create a BST object containing the algorithms required as well as a main function that can take in input files.

During the week prior to November 30th we will test our algorithms together in order to evaluate our questions.
